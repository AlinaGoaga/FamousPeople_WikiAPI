# Wiki API Parser

## How to run

To get the details for a specific celebrity:

```node interface.js celebrity_name```

Expected celebrity name format is: Name_Surname

At the moment the application displays the spouse name, date and place of birth, place of death (if it exists; if it does not "Unavailable" is shown).

The summary isn't displayed - there is a line which has been commented out that has all the information coming from the body and from which this will be extracted at a later stage.

## My approach

- I started by exploring the API to get familiar with the response and how to parse it
- Following my research I decided to use isomorphic-fetch to make the API call and fast-html-parser to parse the HTML response
- I used ```node inspect interface.js``` with ```debugger``` to get visibility on the data available at each step as I was working on the API response
- Ideally I'd have liked to do this test driven and organize the code in classes from the beginning (the class was extracted later on). Unfortunately the lack of familiarity with the type of response led to more time than expected being spent in that section
